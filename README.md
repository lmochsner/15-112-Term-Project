# 15-112 Term Project

For this game Open CV and Kinect are used. In order to play the game a projector is needed. The program has two modes in which a player can chose from. Once the mode is chosen a timer will appear on the wall from the projector. When the timer ends dots will appear one at a time in random positions. The purpose of this game is for the player to hit the dots as they appear. High scores were kept in a txt file that was written to every time the game was run to keep the scores up to date.
